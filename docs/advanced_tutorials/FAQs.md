### How ``saiunit`` is different from other physical unit libraries, such as [Quantities](https://github.com/python-quantities/python-quantities) and [Pint](https://github.com/hgrecco/pint)?


In scientific computing, we already have excellent physical unit libraries, such as `Pint` and `Quantities` in Python, `Unitful.jl` in Julia, `Boost.Units` in C++, and `uom` in Rust. These libraries enable seamless operations, conversions, and calculations among physical units, greatly simplifying the processing and analysis of physical quantities for researchers.

However, existing unit libraries often face significant limitations when dealing with high-performance AI-driven scientific computing.

Firstly, they lack compatibility with mainstream HPC frameworks like PyTorch [Paszke et al., 2019], TensorFlow [Abadi et al., 2016], and JAX [JAX, 2018], hindering their ability to meet the demands of complex scientific computations in parallel computing hardware such as GPUs and TPUs.

Secondly, they generally employ the float64 data type for numerical representation. In contrast, AI for science applications, particularly those using neural networks, often require lower-precision data types to reduce memory usage and improve computational efficiency. This discrepancy may lead to unnecessary performance overhead and limit potential applications in resource-constrained scenarios.

Thirdly, these unit libraries typically lack support for flexible scaling, a crucial feature when dealing with physical quantities exhibiting extreme scale differences. In certain scientific research domains, improper handling of such units may result in precision loss, potentially compromising the accuracy and reliability of research outcomes.

 Finally, a critical limitation of current physical unit systems is their lack of support for automatic differentiation (AD), which is fundamental to modern AI models [Baydin et al., 2018]. This deficiency makes high-order differentiable optimization particularly challenging, limiting the integration of physical units into modern AI-driven research and development pipelines.



### ``SAIUnit`` is previously known as [BrainUnit](https://github.com/chaobrain/brainunit), for brain science. How is it different from units system in previous brain simulators, such as [NEURON](https://nrn.readthedocs.io/en/8.2.6/tutorials/scripting-neuron-basics.html)?

NEURON units are virtual physical units. The implementation details are as follows (copied from https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/blob/master/share/lib/python/neuron/units.py):

```python
""" unit definitions in NEURON simulator"""

# NEURON's default units
mM = 1
ms = 1
mV = 1
µm = um = 1

# concentration
µM = uM = 1e-3 * mM
nM = 1e-6 * mM
M = 1e3 * mM

# time
µs = us = 1e-3 * ms
s = sec = 1e3 * ms
minute = 60 * sec
hour = 60 * minute
day = 24 * hour

# space
nm = 1e-3 * um
mm = 1000 * um
cm = 10 * mm
m = 100 * cm

# voltage
μV = uV = 1e-3 * mV
V = 1e3 * mV
```

In other words, NEURON defines four basic physical units—millivolts (mV), milliseconds (ms), millimoles (mM), and micrometers (µm)—as dimensionless with a value of 1. Other physical units are scaled relative to these base units. This approach, using commonly used scales as the base for scaling (mV, mM, ms, µm), simplifies calculations for frequently used units and ensures consistency in unit conversions.

However, compared to `saiunit`, which provides a fully functional unit system with dimensional analysis and checking, NEURON's virtual unit system has several notable limitations:

1. **Lack of dimensional analysis support**: `saiunit` can verify whether units comply with physical laws, such as velocity units must be `length/time` and force units must be `mass * acceleration`. In NEURON's virtual unit system, relationships between units are hardcoded without automatic dimensional consistency checks. This may lead to users inadvertently mixing units of different dimensions (e.g., using `mV` instead of `mA`) without any warnings or error messages.

2. **Absence of unit derivation**: `saiunit` can perform unit derivation and calculations (e.g., `m/s` * `kg` results in `kg·m/s`) and automatically handle composite units and unit combinations. In contrast, NEURON's virtual unit system only supports its predefined units and lacks the capability to derive composite units. When dealing with more complex physical quantities (such as momentum, current density, etc.), NEURON's unit system may not provide the same convenient calculation or verification capabilities as `saiunit`.

3. **Manual unit management**: Due to the absence of a true physical unit system in NEURON, most dimensional scaling and unit conversions must be performed manually when designing complex calculations. For example, voltage conversions from `mV` to `V`, and conductance conversions from `C/m³` to `C/cm³` require manual handling, as demonstrated in the ``Computing calcium currents using Goldman–Hodgkin–Katz equation`` section (**Lines xxx**). If any step in the conversion process contains errors (e.g., incorrect unit scaling factors), the final simulation results will be affected. This manual conversion process increases the probability of errors.

In summary, while NEURON's virtual unit system simplifies basic unit conversions and enhances code readability, it lacks the robust capabilities found in true unit libraries like `saiunit`, which provide dimensional analysis and unit derivation functionality. This virtual unit system may even create confusion and ambiguity, as demonstrated in their examples where variables with units can be directly used with dimensionless abstract values (https://nrn.readthedocs.io/en/8.2.6/tutorials/scripting-neuron-basics.html#Step-5:-Insert-a-stimulus). Therefore, for applications requiring precise unit management, automatic dimensional checking, complex unit derivation, and extensibility, `saiunit` is undoubtedly more powerful and flexible, effectively preventing errors and improving code maintainability. This comparative analysis have been added to the `saiunit` documentation.



### What are the system requirements for `saiunit`?

`saiunit` can be installed on Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems. The following software and hardware requirements are recommended for optimal performance:

- ``jax>=0.4.30``
- ``python>=3.9``




### How do I set up ``saiunit`` for GPU or TPU usage?

The hardware acceleration of `saiunit` is primarily supported by the `JAX` library, which provides GPU and TPU support for high-performance computing. To enable GPU or TPU usage in `saiunit`, you need to install the appropriate version of `JAX` that supports your hardware configuration. 
Please refer to the [JAX installation guide](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).
