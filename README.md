## Motivation


[``saiunit``](https://github.com/chaobrain/saiunit) provides physical units and unit-aware mathematical system in JAX for brain dynamics and AI4Science. 

It is initially designed to enable unit-aware computations in brain dynamics modeling (see our [ecosystem](https://ecosystem-for-brain-dynamics.readthedocs.io/)).

However, its features and capacities can be applied to general domains in scientific computing and AI for science. 
We also provide ample examples and tutorials to help users integrate ``saiunit`` into their projects 
(see [Unit-aware computation ecosystem](#unit-aware-computation-ecosystem) in the below).


## Features


The uniqueness of ``saiunit`` lies in that it brings physical units handling and AI-driven computation together in a seamless way:

- It provides over 2,000 commonly used physical units and constants.
- It implements over 500 unit-aware mathematical functions.
- Its physical units and unit-aware functions are fully compatible with JAX, including autograd, JIT, vecterization, parallelization, and others.

    A --> C[Mathematical Functions]
    A --> D[JAX Integration]
    B --> B1[2000+ Units]
    B --> B2[Physical Constants]
    C --> C1[500+ Unit-aware Functions]
    D --> D1[Autograd]
    D --> D2[JIT Compilation]
    D --> D3[Vectorization]
    D --> D4[Parallelization]
```

A quick example:

```python

import saiunit as u

# Define a physical quantity
x = 3.0 * u.meter
x
# [out] 3. * meter

# autograd
f = lambda x: x ** 3
u.autograd.grad(f)(x)
# [out] 27. * meter2 


# JIT
import jax
jax.jit(f)(x)
# [out] 27. * klitre

# vmap
jax.vmap(f)(u.math.arange(0. * u.mV, 10. * u.mV, 1. * u.mV))
# [out]  ArrayImpl([  0.,   1.,   8.,  27.,  64., 125., 216., 343., 512., 729.],
#                  dtype=float32) * mvolt3
```



## Installation

You can install ``saiunit`` via pip:

```bash
pip install saiunit --upgrade
```

``saiunit`` has been well tested on ``jax>=0.4.30``, and can be used in Windows, Linux, and MacOS.
